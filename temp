Getting a Multifamily or Commercial Construction Permit from SDCI

Applying for a Construction Permit

Our goal is to provide you with assistance in advance of your application submittal, so that your application materials are complete and accurate, reducing the need for correction cycles that will delay approval.

Step 1. Coaching

Updated July 25, 2022

Coaching for land use and construction is not required, but is available through our Applicant Services Center at www.seattle.gov/sdci/about-us/who-we-are/appli- cant-services-center. For a fee, additional zoning coach- ing with a senior land use planner is available by appoint- ment. Appointments are available in one-hour increments and you must pay the fee before your appointment. The cost of this coaching appointment may be found in our Permit Fee Subtitle: www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes- we-enforce-(a-z)/fees. Sometimes we can answer simple building permit or land use questions through our on-line Q & A: https://sdci.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/ new?ticket_form_id=1500003356822.

This Tip is designed to help you through the construc- tion permit process when you want to construct a new multifamily or commercial building, or when you want to add an addition to an existing multifamily or commercial building. It provides general information on:

 How to apply for your construction permit

 What resources and assistance are available at SDCI

and other City departments

 How long the process is likely to take

Coaching sessions can help you identify unique or par- ticular issues with your proposed project. It is important to receive coaching from a land use planner to deter- mine what is allowed on your property, what develop- ment standards apply, whether your project will require a land use permit, and what the permit process will entail.

 How to track permit status

 How the permit is issued

 How and when to schedule inspections

A multifamily building contains more than two residential dwelling units, such as townhouses or apartment build- ings, but does not have any commercial tenants, such as retail or office spaces.

During coaching, you can explain your project to a plan- ner, who will then help you identify whether any land use permits will be required for your project. The number of dwelling units, the total square footage of the proposed building(s), the amount of parking, and the zoning of the property are primary factors in determining whether SEPA review, shoreline review, design review, and other discretionary reviews will be required. Except for unit lot subdivision permits, most land use permit approvals must be obtained before a construction permit can be approved for your project.

Any building that contains commercial tenants is con- sidered a commercial building. Mixed-use buildings with both residential and commercial uses will also be treated as commercial buildings.

CONSTRUCTION PERMITS

New construction and most alterations of multifamily and commercial buildings will require plan review as part of the construction permit approval process. If your project is minor in nature, please refer to Tip 316, Subject-to-Field- Inspection Permits, to determine whether your project qualifies for a Subject-to-Field-Inspection (STFI) permit.

Pre-Submittal Conferences

projects that trigger the design review process (see Tip 238, Design Review: General Information, Application Instructions, and Submittal Requirements).

walkways or asphalt paving the general topography of your site

 The existing level of street and alley improvements in

the right-of-ways bordering your site

If there is an existing buried oil tank on the site that must be removed, you need a permit. For more information, read the Seattle Fire Department's Administrative Rule 34.02.07, Decommissioning Residential Heating Oil Tanks, available at www.seattle.gov/Documents/De- partments/Fire/Business/AdRule34.02.07.pdf.

Information on how to schedule a pre-submittal confer- ence can be obtained during coaching through the ASC. Please note that you need to submit a preliminary ap- plication package (see Steps 3 and 4) prior to or at the time of requesting a pre-submittal conference.

One copy of the preliminary site plan will be needed for Step 4.

Step 2. Land Use

It is important to find out early whether your project will need a land use permit, as this will affect the timing of the overall permitting process. In general, land use per- mits can take 4-8 months to review, sometimes longer depending on the project complexity.

Step 4. Submit a Preliminary Application Package

Once you know for sure that you are going to build a multifamily or commercial project in Seattle, you should submit a preliminary application package using the Se- attle Services Portal at https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/ Portal/welcome.aspx. A separate package is required for any required land use permits, in addition to the con- struction permit.

Related information to assist you in determining whether your project requires a land use permit are:

 Tip 208, When Environmental Review is Required in Seattle

 Tip 209, Master Use Permit Application Require-

ments for Shoreline Permits

 Tip 210, Master Use Permit Requirements for Variances

You can get the forms for the preliminary application package on our website at www.seattle.gov/sdci/ permits/forms. The package includes the following:

The forms ask that you provide owner and applicant information, a project description and project charac- teristics, and property related information, including the legal description and the King County Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN). After screening the preliminary applica- tion to make sure it is complete, our staff will provide you with a project number you can use to track your project throughout the permitting process.

Step 3. Research and Prepare a Prelimi- nary Site Plan for Your Proposed Project

Your preliminary site plan should be prepared according to the standards outlined in Tips 103, Site Plan Require- ments and 103A, Site Plan Guidelines. Be sure to show:

Most Land Use applications or projects involving ground disturbance will typically require us to conduct a site vis- it. If you have a new construction project, we will share this information from the site visit with other City depart-

ments. They will then have the opportunity to inform you of other important requirements. For example, required right-of-way and utility improvements or whether the site is in an Environmentally Critical Area. It will typically take up to 12 days for us to identify the City requirements.

Additional Application Forms

You can pick up your application forms at the Applicant Services Center (ASC). Most forms are also available at www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/forms. For projects requiring plan review, your plan sets with supporting docu- ments constitute your application.

Once we have determined if there are other requirements for your project, we will mail, email, or fax our findings to you. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you submit the Preliminary Permit Application package a minimum of 8 weeks prior to your desired date for project submittal. Submitting the application form early will pro- vide the time necessary to incorporate any requirements identified by other City departments into your project design prior to submittal.

 Financial responsibility form — required in order to identify who will be held responsible for the permit- ting project fees and costs.

 Contractor disclosure information — required for

all construction projects with a value of more than $5,000, and requires information under Washington State law that must be posted at the job site (e.g., owner, prime contractor, lending institution, etc.).

Step 5. Prepare Detailed Plans for Submittal

The City requirements that we send you in Step 3 should be incorporated into your project design and plan documentation, and you should finalize your de- tailed plans for the proposed development.

 Construction Stormwater Control (CSC) and Drainage Standard Plans – usually required for projects causing site disturbance of less than 5,000 square feet of new or replaced impervious surface. The issues addressed by the CSC plan include soil stabilization over winter months, sediment retention on-site, prevention of pol- lution, and construction vehicle access.

Plan Requirements

 Each plan set should include the items on the

appropriate screening checklist. You can find these checklists at www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/forms. Usually, the plan set includes a site plan; floor, roof, and foundation/basement plans; elevation drawings; and all related structural plans and details. Also include landscaping plans, grading or drainage plans, and street and alley improvement plans.

 Equipment sizing form — deals with Seattle Energy

Code requirements, and is needed if your project con- tains over 500 square feet of new heated space.

 Target UA calculation form — required if you are

not using the Prescriptive Energy Code compliance standards.

 Detailed information about the specific information

required on the plan sheets is outlined in the screening standard documents for multifamily and commercial projects. These documents are available online at www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/forms or you can get them during a coaching visit in the ASC.

	Salvage Assessment - required when either the area of work is greater than 750 square feet or project value exceeds $75,000, and involves some or total demolition. The assessment helps determine which waste materials from your project can possibly be salvaged and reused. You can find the salvage as- sessment form on our forms page at: www.seattle. gov/sdci/permits/forms.

We require a minimum of four full plan sets. We may re- quire up to nine full sets depending on the project scope and the number of distinct reviews involved. During coaching sessions, we will specify the number of plan sets required based on your project scope.

 Step 6. Screening

We require screening prior to submitting your applica- tion unless you are on our list of consistently prepared applicants. This review is to verify that your plans, forms and other documents are complete before you submit them. You must complete steps 3 and 4 before screen- ing. We provide screening in the ASC on a walk-in basis; expect some wait time as there is often a line for these services. We do not charge a fee for your screening. In some instances, your screening can be requested and

Using Professional Designers and Licensed Engineers

We require you to use a professional designer or li- censed engineer to prepare your plan documentation for multifamily and commercial projects for any project with a value of $75,000 or more. Well-prepared plans have a much higher chance of being efficiently reviewed. Our staff cannot recommend designers and builders, but sug-

completed through the Seattle Services Portal at: https:// cosaccela.seattle.gov/Portal/welcome.aspx.

 New multifamily or commercial buildings: 8 weeks

Step 7. Submit Your Street Improvement Engineering Plans

We may reduce some review times for projects partici- pating in the Priority Green Incentive Program. For more information, please visit: www.seattle.gov/sdci/per- mits/green-building.

For multifamily and commercial projects that require street or alley improvements, you need to submit the right-of- way (ROW) plans to the Seattle Department of Trans- portation (SDOT). Your ROW plans need to be accepted for review before you submit your construction permit plans to us. We will not accept Construction permit applications for new buildings until the SDOT plan has been accepted. Street improvement plans must be submitted to SDOT five days in advance for review. SDOT sends us the date on which your plans are accepted for review, which must be prior to your construction permit intake appointment.

Correction Review

It is common for reviewers to identify corrections on multifamily or commercial projects. Many “correc- tions,” however, are actually requests for more informa- tion—another good reason for taking advantage of our coaching services.

We send correction notices by mail, email, or through our online Project Portal, along with the reviewer’s name and phone number. Contact your reviewer directly if you have questions about the requested corrections. We will notify you when all sets are available for correction. Plans needing correction can be either mailed directly to you, accessed through the Seattle Services Portal at https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/Portal/welcome. aspx, or picked up at SDCI Plans Routing, located on the 20th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower at 700 Fifth Ave. To learn more about how to respond to corrections, please visit: www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits.

Step 8. Schedule an Intake Appointment

You must schedule an intake appointment to submit your application. Visit the ASC or call (206) 684-8850 to sched- ule an appointment. Intake appointment wait times vary seasonally, from three working days to several weeks.

You will be required to pay a minimum of 75 percent of the permit fee at your intake appointment. Permit fees are established by the Seattle Permit Fee Subtitle available on our fees page at www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes- we-enforce-(a-z)/fees.

It usually takes us 2-3 weeks to re-review a project after you make the requested corrections and re-submit your plans. Multifamily or commercial projects often have more than one round of corrections from reviewers. To keep your project on time, you should plan for more than one round of reviews when you create a schedule for your project.

PERMIT REVIEWS AND ESTIMATED TURNAROUND TIMES

We always require zoning and building code reviews for multifamily and commercial plan review projects. Depending on your specific proposal, you may need ad- ditional reviews, including: energy/mechanical, geotech- nical, shoring, ECA, grading/drainage, health, and fire.

Tracking Your Permit During Review

You can get information about your permit as it is being processed by looking online at https://cosacce- la.seattle.gov/Portal/welcome.aspx or by checking our online Project Portal. You can also get construction project status by calling 684-8850 and land use project status by calling 684-8467.

Initial Review

Turnaround times for initial plan reviews vary throughout the year. The following estimates are useful as gen- eral guides only. During heavy volume, these time frames can double; please plan your projects ac- cordingly:
